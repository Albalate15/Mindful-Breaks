Concept: This website would offer quick, guided mindfulness and meditation exercises for people to take "micro-breaks" during work or study. 
The idea here is to offer short, 2-5 minute audio or video-guided sessions that users can access easily to refresh their minds. 
The twist is that it could analyze users' stress levels or focus based on quick surveys or integrated wearable data, and then recommend the right kind of break.
